App Idea: "SportMate – AI Personal Sports Companion"

✅ App Overview
SportMate is a React-based web application that acts as a personal assistant for sports enthusiasts. The application helps users find suitable sports based on habits, weather, and location; provides AI-based exercise and nutrition recommendations; and provides daily sports activity tracking features.
SportMate uses AI technology (OpenAI) to provide personalized suggestions, and leverages data from third-party sports APIs (e.g. weather API, gym locations, or RapidAPI for sports schedules) to enhance the user experience.

🧩 Key Features

1. Sport Recommendation AI
- Uses OpenAI to suggest suitable sports based on user preferences, weather, and free time.
- Example prompt: “I have 1 hour every evening and a weak knee. What sport should I try?”
2. Daily Fitness & Nutrition Plan Generator
- AI generates daily exercise and nutrition plans based on user goals (e.g.: slim, muscular, healthy).

3. Live Weather Integration
- Using 3rd Party API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap API) to display today's weather and provide suggestions on whether outdoor sports are suitable.
4. Nearby Sports Facilities
- Integration with Google Maps API or RapidAPI to find nearby sports venues (gyms, fields, etc.).
5. Progress Tracker
- Manual or automatic input (using charts) of daily activities and progress (based on Redux state).
6. Chatbot Motivator (AI)
- AI chatbot with mood tracking: provides encouragement, tips, and reminds weekly targets.
7. Social Media Sign-In
- User authentication via Login.
